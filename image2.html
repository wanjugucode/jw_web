    <div class="title1"><b>Antique Natural Wild Pearl (East Pearl) Jewellery of the Qing Dynasty</b></div>
    <div class="title">   <br> <br style="text-align: justify;">
        In the Qing Dynasty, wild pearls without seedlings produced in China’s Songhua River, Heilongjiang, Wusuli River, Yalu River and their watersheds were called ‘East Pearls’. Due to its natural formation, it is very rare, which makes it very difficult to acquire. Emperor Qianlong wrote in his poem ‘Pearl Picking Journey’, ‘It is difficult to find one in a hundred times, and it is a rare treasure.’ Due to various reasons, the mussels that grow east pearls have long been extinct. According to the ‘Qing Collected Statutes’, only emperors, empresses, and empress dowagers can wear and own east pearls, which is a symbol of supreme power, and no one else can have them.
        Being rare to see and hard to get, east pearls are luxurious and very precious. Since the last century, it has been a treasure that is in short supply in the collection and auction markets all over the world. At Sotheby’s 2010 Spring Auction in Hong Kong, a string of 18th-century imperial east pearls from the Qing Dynasty set off fierce bidding and was finally sold at a price of HK$67.86 million.
        The natural antique wild pearls of the Qing Dynasty collected by Kejia are all east pearls, and is the art exchange which owns the most east pearls in China and even the world. Not only the appearance of east pearls is good, but also the particles are large, which is very rare. Designed by world-class jewellery designers, it incorporates traditional Chinese auspicious cultures such as Fu, Lu, Shou, Xi, and Cai, as well as bergamot, hibiscus, bat, gourd, sea, and pomegranate, which imply longevity, wealth, harmony and many blessings. The pattern symbols of peace are embellished with precious metals such as gold and modern diamonds and gemstones, which not only fully demonstrates the incomparable elegance and luxury of antique wild east pearls in Qing Dynasty, but also further enhances the value of east pearls as a collection and increases the cultural taste of east pearls jewellery.
